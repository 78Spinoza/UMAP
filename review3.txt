1. uwot_fit.cpp
Summary: Handles model fitting, normalization, neighbor stats, HNSW tuning, and recall validation.
Strengths:

Comprehensive stats (min, mean, std, percentiles) for distances.
Auto-tuning of HNSW ef_search based on recall.
Progress callbacks integrated well.

Issues:

compute_normalization: Uses static_cast<size_t> for indexing, but no overflow checks for large n_obs * n_dim.
compute_neighbor_statistics: Skips self-distance correctly, but HNSW distance conversions assume specific metrics—add a comment explaining why (e.g., HNSW returns squared for L2).
tune_hnsw_params: Quick recall uses only 20 samples; could be configurable. max_ef_search hardcoded based on size—make it a parameter.
validate_hnsw_recall: Full brute-force exact k-NN per sample is slow for large n_dim; sample size (100) is reasonable but could warn if n_obs is small.
Broad catch (...) in loops—log the error instead.
Truncated code at end; assuming it's complete, ensure no resource leaks.

Improvements:

Use std::span<const float> for data to avoid raw pointers.
Factor out distance conversion into a helper function (duplicated in transform.cpp).
Add SIMD (e.g., via OpenMP SIMD pragma) to mean/std loops.
Make exact_match_threshold configurable or explain the magic number (1e-3 / sqrt(n_dim)).
Suggestion: Add a struct NeighborStats to hold min/mean/std/etc., reducing parameter clutter.

2. uwot_distance.cpp
Summary: Distance metric implementations and utilities.
Strengths:

Handles edge cases like zero-norm/zero-variance well, with tolerances.
Validation functions (e.g., validate_hamming_data) sample data to avoid full scans.
compute_distance switches cleanly.

Issues:

hamming_distance: Uses 1e-6f tolerance—make it a constant.
correlation_distance: Returns 1.0f for zero-variance (max distance), but docs say "maximum distance (zero correlation)"—consistent, but add unit tests.
validate_metric_data: Uses fprintf(stderr)—use callbacks or logging instead.
find_knn_exact: Builds full distance list then sorts—inefficient for large n_obs; use partial_sort for top-k.
build_distance_matrix: O(n^2) with progress—good, but could parallelize outer loop with OpenMP.
Truncated code; ensure no missing parts.

Improvements:

Templatize distances for double/float if needed.
Use std::hypot or fused multiply-add for Euclidean to reduce FP errors.
Add vectorized versions (e.g., with AVX intrinsics) for hot paths.
Replace fprintf with a logging macro that uses global callback.

3. uwot_hnsw_utils.cpp
Summary: HNSW space factory, streaming, and normalization.
Strengths:

Secure temp file generation with crypto-secure random.
Normalization modes (z-score, L2) well-defined.
Parallel addition for large datasets.

Issues:

generate_unique_temp_filename: Uses std::filesystem (C++17)—good, but fallback could be more robust.
save_hnsw_to_stream: Direct stream copy—efficient.
load_hnsw_from_stream: Copies fixed size—add checks if stream has enough data.
add_points_to_hnsw: Assumes HNSW is thread-safe (it is, per docs), but confirm in comments.
normalize_data_consistent: Modifies output_data in-place if mode=0—document side effects.
Truncated code; ensure full implementation.

Improvements:

Use std::span for data views.
Add compression to streaming (e.g., integrate LZ4 here too).
Make determine_normalization_mode return an enum for clarity.

4. uwot_transform.cpp
Summary: Transforms new data using fitted model.
Strengths:

Detailed metrics (confidence, outlier, percentile, z-score) for AI inference—very useful.
Handles quantization fallback gracefully.
Boosts ef_search for better recall.

Issues:

Raw memcpy replaced with safe loop—good fix, but use std::copy instead.
Broad catch (...)—specify std::exception.
Duplicated distance conversion logic from fit.cpp.
Assumes model->embedding_space_index exists—checked, but error code could be more specific.
Truncated code; verify full stats calculations.

Improvements:

Refactor shared code (e.g., normalization, distance conversion) into utils.
Add batch transform for multiple points to amortize overhead.
Use std::clamp (C++17) for scores.

5. uwot_simple_wrapper.cpp
Summary: C API wrapper.
Strengths:

Clean extern "C" for FFI.
Forwards to utils functions.

Issues:

No input validation (e.g., null checks on pointers).
Global callback—thread-local is good, but document usage.

Improvements:

Add null checks and return errors early.
Use const where possible (e.g., const float* data).

6. uwot_quantization.cpp
Summary: PQ for compression.
Strengths:

Deterministic init with seed 42.
Handles empty clusters by re-init.

Issues:

Fixed k=256—hardcoded for 8-bit.
Simple k-means: No early stopping if converged early (fixed in code with epsilon).
No parallelism in k-means.

Improvements:

Parallelize assignment/update with OpenMP.
Add convergence logging via callback.

7. uwot_persistence.cpp
Summary: Model saving/loading with compression.
Strengths:

LZ4 compression with bounds checks—secure.
Endian-safe—excellent.
Fallback reconstruction from PQ/embeddings.

Issues:

Temp file risks (though mitigated).
Broad catches.
Truncated heavily; ensure full save/load symmetry.

Improvements:

Use protobuf or flatbuffers for structured serialization.
Add version checks during load.

8. uwot_progress_utils.cpp
Summary: Progress and utils.
Strengths:

Human-readable time formatting.
Safe callback invocation.

Issues:

Global thread-local vars—fine, but prefer passing as params.

Improvements:

Add rate limiting to callbacks to avoid spam.

9. uwot_model.cpp
Summary: Model creation and info.
Strengths:

Simple, error-coded getters.

Issues:

No deep copy/clone for models.

Improvements:

Add move semantics if models are copyable.
