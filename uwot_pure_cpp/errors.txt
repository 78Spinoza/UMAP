Missing L2 Normalization for Cosine Metric in HNSW (Incorrect Results):

Files: uwot_fit.cpp, uwot_hnsw_utils.cpp.
In NormalizationPipeline::determine_normalization_mode, Cosine uses mode=0 (copy data), but for HNSW InnerProductSpace to approximate cosine (1 - sim), vectors must be L2-normalized to unit length before adding (add_points_to_hnsw). Without this, HNSW approximates dot product (favors longer vectors), not cosine. Exact KNN (cosine_distance) computes norms properly, leading to inconsistency between approx/exact modes. In compute_neighbor_statistics, distance adjustment (1.0 + dist) assumes unit norms. Synthetic data (normal dist) has varying norms, exacerbating this. Fix: Add mode=2 for Cosine (L2 normalize each vector independently in normalize_data_consistent). Impacts: Wrong embeddings/neighbors for Cosine users.


No Endian Handling in Binary Save/Load (Data Corruption Cross-Platform):

File: uwot_persistence.cpp.
save_model/load_model writes/reads floats/ints directly (file.write/read). On big-endian vs. little-endian systems, values corrupt (e.g., floats swapped). No magic number or endian check. Impacts: Model files unusable across architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). Fix: Use portable serialization (e.g., write in little-endian always) or add endian detection.


Potential Memory Corruption in Bounds-Checked Copies (If Sizes Mismatch):

File: uwot_fit.cpp (in optimize_layout, element-wise copy to embedding).
Checks model->embedding.size() < expected, returns error. But if mismatch occurs (e.g., due to earlier alloc fail), partial copy could overrun. Similar in other vec resizes/copies (e.g., reconstructed_data in persistence). Impacts: Rare crashes/OOM. Fix: Use std::copy with iterators and resize first.


Temp File Usage Without Secure Creation (Security Vulnerability):

Files: uwot_hnsw_utils.cpp, uwot_persistence.cpp.
generate_unique_temp_filename uses timestamp+random, but no O_EXCL or secure open (e.g., mkstemp). Race conditions possible (attacker predicts/creates file). No permission checks (e.g., 0600). If /tmp full/no-write, fails silently. Impacts: Local exploits (symlink attacks); failures in restricted envs. Fix: Use std::filesystem::temp_directory_path + std::tmpfile or mkstemp.


LZ4 Decompression Without Full Validation (Buffer Overrun Risk):

File: uwot_persistence.cpp (load_hnsw_from_stream_compressed).
Uses LZ4_decompress_safe, which is bounds-checked, but if compressed_size/original_size corrupted in file, allocates large vectors (up to 500MB cap, but cap arbitrary). No checksum. Impacts: OOM/crash on malformed files. Fix: Add CRC32 checksum; lower caps.



High Severity (Logical Errors or Performance Issues)

Fragile Loss Parsing in Callbacks (Breaks if Format Changes):

File: test_standard_comprehensive.cpp (loss_tracking_callback).
Parses "Loss: X.XXX" from message via strstr/sscanf. If upstream changes format (e.g., "loss=..."), fails. Impacts: Tests report wrong loss/convergence. Fix: Pass loss directly, not via string.


Insufficient K-Means Iterations in PQ (Poor Codebooks):

File: uwot_quantization.cpp (simple_kmeans).
Fixed 25 iterations; for 256 clusters, may not converge (esp. with bad init). Empty clusters keep old centroids (no re-init). Impacts: Suboptimal quantization, higher MSE in tests/reconstructions. Fix: Add convergence check (e.g., epsilon on change); re-init empty clusters.


HNSW Reconstruction from PQ is Lossy Without Warning (Inconsistent Transforms):

File: uwot_persistence.cpp (load_model).
If no HNSW saved (e.g., after quantization in fit), reconstructs from PQ (lossy), rebuilds HNSW. Neighbors may differ from original. No user warning. Impacts: Non-reproducible transforms post-load. Fix: Log warning via callback; store exact KNN always as fallback.


No Parallelism in HNSW Point Addition (Performance Bottleneck):

File: uwot_hnsw_utils.cpp (add_points_to_hnsw).
Sequential addPoint for all n_obs. HNSWlib supports parallel adds but not used. Impacts: Slow build for large n_obs (e.g., >1M). Fix: Use OpenMP loop if HNSWlib thread-safe.


Assumes Data Suitable for Metrics (Silent Wrong Results):

File: uwot_distance.cpp.
Hamming assumes binary floats (diff >1e-6f); if not 0/1, wrong. Correlation assumes meaningful means. No validation. Impacts: Garbage in/out for bad data. Fix: Add metric-specific checks/warnings.



Medium Severity (Code Smells/Maintainability)

Duplicated Code for HNSW Stream Utils (Maintainability):

Files: uwot_hnsw_utils.cpp and uwot_persistence.cpp have similar save/load_compressed funcs. Impacts: Bug fixes in one missed in other. Fix: Consolidate into one module.


Hardcoded Seeds and Params (Limited Testing):

Files: test_*.cpp, uwot_quantization.cpp.
Fixed seeds (42); good for repro but may miss edge cases. N_EPOCHS=100/200 reduced for speed, but may not test full convergence. Impacts: Tests miss rare bugs. Fix: Parametrize seeds/epochs.


Unused/Empty Functions (Dead Code):

File: uwot_persistence.cpp (debug_print_model_state empty).
Impacts: Clutter. Fix: Remove or implement.


Potential Integer Overflow in Size Calcs:

Multiple files (e.g., vec.resize(n_obs * n_dim)).
For large n_obs/n_dim, size_t overflow. Impacts: OOM/crash. Fix: Add checks (e.g., if n_obs > SIZE_MAX / n_dim).



Low Severity (Minor Optimizations/Style)

Printf Typos in Test Output:

File: test_standard_comprehensive.cpp.
printf "%.1s" for emojis (should be %s). Impacts: Garbled output. Fix: Correct format.


Unnecessary Globals if Not Multi-Threaded:

File: uwot_progress_utils.cpp.
thread_local g_current_epoch_loss good, but if single-threaded, overkill. Impacts: None major.
